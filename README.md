# How to set up project
1. Clone repo to your machine
2. Open the iml file with intellij
3. Make sure the src and tests directories are marked correctly (right-click -> 'Mark Directory as' -> 'Sources Root'/'Test Sources Root') If configured correctly, the tests folder should be green and src folder blue
4. Make sure you have annotationdocklets set up in libraries (see libs folder)
5. Make sure you have junit 4 added in libraries (guide on toledo)
